# Pseudo coding a message broker
Creating a message broker that avoids vendor lock-in involves designing a system that can handle various messaging protocols and formats, allowing it to communicate with different systems regardless of the technology stack they're using. This approach ensures flexibility and interoperability across different platforms and services. Here's a high-level pseudocode outline for such a message broker:

### Step 1: Define Interfaces for Message Protocols

First, define interfaces for handling common messaging protocols like AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), and HTTP(S) REST APIs. These interfaces will abstract away the specifics of each protocol, allowing the broker to work with them interchangeably.

```pseudo
interface IMessageProtocolHandler {
    void send(message: Message);
    Message receive();
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Protocol Handlers

Implement classes for each messaging protocol that adhere to the `IMessageProtocolHandler` interface. Each class will contain the logic specific to its protocol but will expose a unified API through the interface.

```pseudo
class AmqpHandler implements IMessageProtocolHandler {
    // Implementation details for sending and receiving messages via AMQP
}

class MqttHandler implements IMessageProtocolHandler {
    // Implementation details for sending and receiving messages via MQTT
}

class RestApiHandler implements IMessageProtocolHandler {
    // Implementation details for sending and receiving messages via HTTP(S)
}
```

### Step 3: Broker Logic

The core of the message broker will manage connections to these handlers, dispatching messages based on their destination and protocol. It should also handle message routing, persistence, and delivery acknowledgments.

```pseudo
class MessageBroker {
    private handlers: Map<String, IMessageProtocolHandler>;

    constructor() {
        this.handlers = new Map(); // Initialize with default handlers if needed
    }

    registerHandler(protocol: string, handler: IMessageProtocolHandler) {
        this.handlers.set(protocol, handler);
    }

    sendMessage(destination: string, message: Message, protocol: string) {
        const handler = this.handlers.get(protocol);
        if (handler!= null) {
            handler.send(message);
        } else {
            throw new Error("No handler found for protocol " + protocol);
        }
    }

    receiveMessage(source: string, protocol: string): Promise<Message> {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            const handler = this.handlers.get(protocol);
            if (handler!= null) {
                try {
                    resolve(handler.receive());
                } catch (error) {
                    reject(error);
                }
            } else {
                reject(new Error("No handler found for protocol " + protocol));
            }
        });
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Configuration and Runtime

At runtime, the broker can be configured to add or remove handlers dynamically, allowing it to adapt to changes in the messaging landscape without requiring downtime or reconfiguration. This flexibility is crucial for avoiding vendor lock-in, as it enables the broker to integrate with new technologies or protocols as they emerge.

This pseudocode provides a basic framework for building a message broker that is designed to avoid vendor lock-in. By abstracting the messaging protocols behind a common interface, the broker can seamlessly integrate with a wide range of messaging systems, ensuring interoperability and flexibility in communication between disparate systems and applications.
